# JCal WordPress template

development
- set up wordpress in mamp
- clone this repo into wp-content > themes folder
- activate the theme in wp-admin
- run `npm run tw` to watch for tailwind
- you may need to edit php.ini (find the proper directory by running `phpinfo()`) to set max_post_size to a higher amount
- for some reason php 8.x had errors? so use php 7.4 for now
